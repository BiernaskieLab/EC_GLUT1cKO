Python files corresponding to generation of volcano plots.

Datasets are included as .csv files, independently for each brain section and region of interest.

Both 1-month and 12-month mice are included in regional analysis. (testing done in globalanalysis independently).

Note that 'ventricle' variables are carried over for downstream analysis, though indices reference correct brain region.

Analyses include both log-transform and min-max scaled data.
