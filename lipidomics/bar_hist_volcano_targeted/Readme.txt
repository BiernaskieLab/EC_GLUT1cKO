Python files corresponding to generation of bar plots, kernel density estimates (histogram),
and volcano plots are provided in their respective folder.

Datasets are included as .csv files, independently for each brain section and region of interest.
i.e. section_number-brain_region.csv


Note that a consolidated table of means (ko/ctrl) and pvalues were calculated using the xx_spectralprocmean_bar.py script,
and manually copied to respective files prior to volcano plots.
i.e. mko.csv, mctrl.csv, pvalues.csv
